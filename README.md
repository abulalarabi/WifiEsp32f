# WiFiEsp32f
This is a workaround of WiFiEsp library (https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp) to work with STM32F103 generic bluepill devices. All credit goes to the original developer. I have added few libraries and changed few headers. The tinyvsnprintf library credit goes to (https://github.com/stm32duino/I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1).
